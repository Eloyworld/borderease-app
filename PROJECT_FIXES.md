# Fixes Applied - [Date]

## Issues Resolved:
1. Settings button not working - Fixed import syntax for default exports
2. Explore button not working - Simplified screen and fixed imports
3. Component import issues - Changed from @/ alias to relative paths

## Key Changes:
- All component imports now use relative paths (../components/...)
- All default exports are imported without curly braces
- Minimal working versions of settings and explore screens

## If Issues Reoccur:
1. Restore from backup-final-working
2. Check import syntax for default vs named exports
3. Verify all paths are relative, not using @/ alias
